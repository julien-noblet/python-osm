## DESCRIPTION

python-osm contains tools to read Open Street Map Data (*.osm).
It is splitted into several python classes:

**src/pyosm.py**:
base class that contains the datamodel of osm. It parses the osm
file or data and puts every osm-object into pythonobjects.

**src/multipolygon.py**:
analyzes a multipolygon relation and provides a node-in-polygon check.
This class can export a polygon files for osmosis, too.

**src/osmdb.py**:
offers an api to read osm objects from large or large compressed osm files
like the planet.

**tools/relation2gpx.py**:
Exports one or more relations into a gpx file. This tool can be used to
create gpx tracks for your gps-unit or to create maps with routes.

**tools/osmhistory.py**:
With this tool you can get an old versions of osm-objects at a given
timestamp. (experimental, use with care)

see also: **doc/index.html** for more documentation.
